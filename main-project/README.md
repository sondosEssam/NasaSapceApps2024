# Solar System Orrery & NEO Visualizer üåé‚òÑÔ∏è

## About The Project
This interactive web application was developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. It provides a dynamic visualization of our solar system, Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), combining educational content with engaging interactive features.

### Challenge
**Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects**

## Features

### üåü Interactive Dynamic Orrery
- Real-time visualization of planets in our solar system
- Display of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)
- Visualization of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)
- Interactive celestial body cards with fascinating facts upon clicking

### üéÆ Space Defense Mini-Game
- 2D arcade-style gameplay
- Control a spacecraft through an asteroid field
- Defend against and destroy incoming asteroids
- Mission: Successfully navigate back to Earth

### üì± Today's Space Card
- Daily updated information about space events
- Current astronomical phenomena
- Interesting space facts

## How to Use

1. **Main Orrery View**
   - Use mouse/touch controls to navigate the solar system
   - Click on any celestial body to view detailed information
   - Toggle between different visualization modes

2. **Mini-Game**
   - Launch the game from the main interface
   - Use [controls] to navigate your spacecraft
   - Avoid or destroy asteroids to protect Earth

## Technical Details
Three.js was used for visualization and Gemini API was used for providing cards' info.
